    "### 1. 1 Background Information\n",
    "Almost everybody is moving to another place - at least once in a lifetime. Starting to study in a new city, during a semester abroad, after changing the job, or moving together with a new partner are only some of the reasons why people would find a new place to live. Besides the price of the housing, another important factor is its surrounding. When moving to another place, people most likely would like to find a place that is comparable to the current home to feel comfortable. Even though different people put emphasis on different venues: For example, for some it might be interesting to have a Gym nearby, while other prefer good restaurants or coffee stores nearby - they all have the same problem in common: How to find a place that meets the personal requirements? In this report we will answer this question using Data Science Methods.\n",

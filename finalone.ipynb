Along with being two of US most famous diplomatic centres, they are major centres for finance, commerce, sciences, fashion, arts, culture and gastronomy. Both New York City(NYC)  and Miami, FL have a rich history and are two of the most visited and sought-after cities in US. New York City is the most populous city in the United States and stands on Hudson River in southeastern New York State. Miami, on the other hand,located in southeastern Florida in the United States. Similar to NYC, the city also stands along a river, commonly known as the Miami River.\nOur goal is to perform a comparison of the two cities to see how similar or dissimilar they are. Such techniques allow users to identify similar neighbourhoods among cities based on amenities or services being offered locally, and thus can help in understanding the local area activities, what are the hubs of different activities, how citizens are experiencing the city, and how they are utilising its resources."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Business Problem:\nThe goal is to perform a comparison of the two cities (NYC and Miami) to see how similar or dissimilar they are. It involves doing a city-to-city comparison to find similar neighbourhoods between NYC and Miami based on a venue based comparison approach. Major Boroughs in NYC are compared with the corresponding administrative districts (arrondissements municipaux) in Miami. Such techniques allow users to identify similar neighbourhoods among cities based on amenities or services being offered locally, and thus can help in understanding the local area activities, what are the hubs of different activities, how citizens are experiencing the city, and how they are utilising its resources."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Target Audience:\nThere are many practical questions which can be answered using such a comparison. For instance, a job seeker with transferable skills may wish to search for jobs in selective cities/ a single city which provide the most suitable match for her qualifications and experience, in terms of salaries, social benefits, or even in terms of a culture fit for expats. Further, a person buying or renting a home in a new city may want to compare the neighbourhoods of the city to other cities known to her. Such a study would help in recommending locations in the new city. Similarly, a large corporation looking to expand its locations to other cities might benefit from such an analysis. Many within-city urban planning computations might also benefit from modelling a city\u2019s relationship to other cities. Thus, the problem has numerous applications in analysis of cities and urban planning."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data Source:\n[Miami wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Miami)<br>\n[NYC wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City#:~:text=Community%20Boards%20in%20New%20York%20City%20%20,%20Concourse%2C%20Highbridge%20%2022%20more%20rows%20)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
